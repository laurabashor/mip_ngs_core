### This document provides general guidelines for using the NGS Core lab space and instruments.

## NGS Email List
All users must sign up for the NGS email list here: https://lists.colostate.edu/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/ngs_announcements

## Training
All users must be trained before using any equipment. Contact Marylee for training.

## Scheduling
- Please use the shared Outlook Calendar: `CVMBS MIP NGS Access`
- You do not have permissions to edit the calendar, so please send Marylee an email with the following information:
a) Desired Run Date
b) PI Name
c) Account Number
d) Kit type

- For MiSeq and NextSeq runs, you must load your run by noon on your scheduled day. This prevents your run from continuing into the next persons run. 

- Please coordinate with Marylee to schedule a time to use any other piece of equipment including the QuantStudio3, tapestation, etc. The lab is busy, so this will help prevent two people from trying to use the same equipment at the same time.

## Billing
- For sequencing runs, please provide the account number when you schedule a run. 
- For all other equipment, please fill out the log book in the NGS Core with the following: 
a) What you used
b) Your full name
c) Your PI's name
d) Account Number

## Lab Etiquette
- Please clean the bench space with 70% ethanol before and after using.
- Please clean up after yourself. Do not leave equipment or tubes laying around. 
- We refill the blue pipet boxes, please don't throw them away.
- If you notice something is running low, please let Marylee know so that she can restock.
